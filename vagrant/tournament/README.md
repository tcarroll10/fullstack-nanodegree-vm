### Files

There are three files for this project:
-***tournament.sql***- includes the DDL for the tournament db schema.  
-***tournament.py***- includes code of your module.   
-***tournament_test.py*** - includes the unit tests that will test the functions in tournament.py.   

### Install
You will need both python and postgreSQL to run the project. The best approach may be to install Udacity's VM. Follow link below for details on how to do this:
